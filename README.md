## Interests

## Technical Background
Currently, I would consider myself to be proficient in Java and Python, but also have used C and some bash and linux environments as well. I am comfortable using VM's and such, and a bit of networking background with configuring routers and switches and cable management. Most of my experience is from courses, including configuring and subnetting a home and office network, and a little hardware experience from working on PC's and a intro to hardware course.
